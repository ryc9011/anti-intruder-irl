# anti-intruder-irl
Tries to trick people that are snooping on your computer IRL (not remotely).

This program locks your computer when it is clicked and leaves an intruder.txt file behind when clicked. Intruder.txt is stored in %userprofile%\intruder.txt. This will also allow you to see what time the intrusion occured. When you return to your computer after an intrusion occured, delete intruder.txt. That way, when you set it next time, it can create a new intruder.txt.
  
This program is mostly just for fun and doesn't serve a huge functional purpose.
